# Part 107 Resources


When it comes to Part 107 study material, the internet is jam packed; however, many videos you watch will prompt you to pay for a course, and some practice exams will make you pay in order to see your results, but **this is not necessary.** Below are the resources that I found to be the most useful (and free).

## **General**
***
- This audible audio book covers most of the major topics of the exam. It's around $15 but you can do a 1-month free trial. I found it to be a good starting point (~3hrs of listening).

- This YouTube playlist covers most major topics of the exam as well.

## **Aeronautical Charts (Sectionals)**

- YouTube playlist that goes over aeronautical charts (sectionals) for the Part 107 exam: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzI-qUI5CdZ3mxx8zoQuXCc5Q2fXoOl73](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzI-qUI5CdZ3mxx8zoQuXCc5Q2fXoOl73)
- Great resource for practice using/familiarizing yourself with sectionals: [https://skyvector.com/](https://skyvector.com/)

## **Weather**

- YouTube playlist containing various useful videos, but the parts on weather were of particular use: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGspbs93n4nP5g4SFPOJswZ21Qv3ynl1K](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGspbs93n4nP5g4SFPOJswZ21Qv3ynl1K)

## **Practice Exams**
***

You can find practice exams scoured around the internet, but I found the official FAA practice exam to be of most use. You can access it from the PSI Exams website which is the same website you will go to in order to schedule your exam.
